```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## This is an Example Workflow for J5 Opentrons Usage

### Parse the Combinatorial File

```{r J5_data_parsing}
#directory for parse_j5 already defined in setup
parse_j5(path = "./J5_EricZirkle_GH3_mCherry/")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
