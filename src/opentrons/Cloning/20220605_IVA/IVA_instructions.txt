Place the coldtuberack in slot 1. 
put 300uL tips in slot 6 & 9, and 10uL tips in slot 5. 
put in a fresh pcr plate into thermocycler. 
Instructions for setting up the coldtuberack: 
Put oWL00357_(backbone)_forward in A1

Put oWL00368_(tsPurple)_reverse in B6
Put oWL00369_(eforCP)_forward in C1
Put oWL00370_(eforCP)_reverse in C2
NOTE: if a template is listed twice, (ie, pwl106 in B6 and C3) then skip the second position, and move remaining templates up a slot 
This is ok because this setup sheet and df object in the script are both set up from pcr.csv, except df just takes out repeasts.
