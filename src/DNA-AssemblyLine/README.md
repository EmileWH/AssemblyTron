# DNtegrate

An open-source python package to integrate DNA vector design and assembly using the OT-2 liquid handling robot  

Our goal with this project is to automate the error-prone DNA assembly cloning process. This open-source python package integrates Opentrons liquid handling API with DNA construct design files. This package will automatically generate PCR parameters, dilution factors, output files, etc. for any DNA construct designed with the J5 algorithm. 	Code is being tested with a variety of DNA construct designs in the [Plant Synthetic Biology lab](https://sites.google.com/vt.edu/wrightlab) and is nearing release.
