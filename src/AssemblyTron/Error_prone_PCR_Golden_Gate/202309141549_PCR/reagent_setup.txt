Put oWL00378_(Yukon)_reverse in A4
Add an empty tube to A4 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put oWL00379_(bb2)_forward in A5
Add an empty tube to A5 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put oWL00380_(bb2)_reverse in A6
Add an empty tube to A6 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put oWL00381_(AmpR)_forward in B1
Add an empty tube to B1 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put oWL00382_(AmpR)_reverse in B2
Add an empty tube to B2 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put oWL00383_(fuGFP)_forward in B3
Add an empty tube to B3 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put oWL00384_(fuGFP)_reverse in B4

Put oWL00385_(tsPurple)_forward in B5
Add an empty tube to B5 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put oWL00386_(tsPurple)_reverse in B6
Add an empty tube to B6 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put oWL00387_(eforCP)_forward in C1
Add an empty tube to C1 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
Put oWL00388_(eforCP)_reverse in C2
Add an empty tube to C2 on 24 well tuberack in slot 2.
NOTE: if a template is listed twice, (ie, pwl106 in B6 and C3) then skip the second position, and move remaining templates up a slot 
This is ok because this setup sheet and df object in the script are both set up from pcr.csv, except df just takes out repeasts.  
These go in the cold tuberack again.
