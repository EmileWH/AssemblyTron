Place the coldtuberack in slot 1. 
Put 300uL tips in slot 6 & 9, and 10uL tips in slot 5. 
Instructions for setting up the coldtuberack: 
Put oWL00624_(ARF7)_forward in A1
Put oWL597_(ARF7)_reverse in A2
Put oWL598_(ARF7-pb1)_forward in A3
Put oWL00625_(PB1_ARF7)_(stop2)_reverse in A4
Put oWL00626_(IAA14-FL)_forward in A5
Put oWL593_(TPL-IAA14)_reverse in A6
Put oWL594_(IAA14-pb1)_forward in B1
Put oWL595_(IAA14-pb1)_reverse in B2
NOTE: if a template is listed twice, (ie, pwl106 in B6 and C3) then skip the second position, and move remaining templates up a slot 
This is ok because this setup sheet and df object in the script are both set up from pcr.csv, except df just takes out repeasts.  
Put pwl90 in B3
Put pwl248 in B4
