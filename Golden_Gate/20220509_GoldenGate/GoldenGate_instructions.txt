Place the coldtuberack in slot 1. 
put 300uL tips in slot 6 & 9, and 10uL tips in slot 5. 
put in a fresh pcr plate into thermocycler. 
Instructions for setting up the coldtuberack: 
Put oWL00375_(backbone)_forward in A1
Put oWL00376_(backbone)_reverse in A2
Put oWL00377_(Yukon)_forward in A3
Put oWL00378_(Yukon)_reverse in A4
Put oWL00379_(bb2)_forward in A5
Put oWL00380_(bb2)_reverse in A6
Put oWL00381_(AmpR)_forward in B1
Put oWL00382_(AmpR)_reverse in B2
Put oWL00383_(fuGFP)_forward in B3
Put oWL00384_(fuGFP)_reverse in B4
Put oWL00385_(tsPurple)_forward in B5
Put oWL00386_(tsPurple)_reverse in B6
Put oWL00387_(eforCP)_forward in C1
Put oWL00388_(eforCP)_reverse in C2
NOTE: if a template is listed twice, (ie, pwl106 in B6 and C3) then skip the second position, and move remaining templates up a slot 
This is ok because this setup sheet and df object in the script are both set up from pcr.csv, except df just takes out repeasts.
